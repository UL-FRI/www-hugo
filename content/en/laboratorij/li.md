The focus of the research here includes software development methodologies and business process evaluation. We offer efficient approaches to the evaluation of information systems, specific information solutions and specific IT related processes. The approaches break down IT products or IT processes into key elements and evaluate them through a comprehensive set of criteria. We have excellent references in the areas of information system strategic planning and context aware applications, where we have developed a context engine prototype.

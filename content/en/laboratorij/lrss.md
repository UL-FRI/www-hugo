The laboratory is focused on the computational methods for modelling, simulation and analysis of fundamentally different system families. We are interested in computational approaches in systems and synthetic biology, the analysis of coordinated behaviour in biological systems, the design of quantum-dot cellular automata processing structures, and the understanding of human behaviour through the analysis of mobile sensing data. The laboratory therefore consists of four groups, the Computational Biology Group, the Collective Behaviour Group, the Quantum-dot Cellular Automata group and the Mobile Computing Group.

We research the capture, processing and interpretation of 2D and 3D visual data, machine learning in computer vision, and the use of images in computer-human interactions. We work in the following specific areas: interactive visual signage systems, 3D documentation in archaeology and cultural heritage, interpretation of images in biometry, medicine, geology and meteorology, the forensic analysis of images and video, virtual and augmented reality, as well as in the production of computer games and in new media art installations (in cooperation with the Academy of Fine Arts).

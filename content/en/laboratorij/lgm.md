The laboratory performs R&D in the fields of multimedia technologies, human-computer interaction and computer graphics. Our main focus is on audio processing and music information retrieval (audio understanding, organization of music archives), interactive 3D visualization (medical imaging, games, VR/AR), and e-Learning (learning for people with disabilities, gamification). We have extensive experience in developing software solutions for desktop, mobile and cloud platforms and are active in the development of visualizations, interactive learning systems, and didactic games.

The prime area of research interest is efficient data handling in distributed pervasive environments, which store terabytes of data that present a challenge in at least two areas: the efficient storage and handling of the data. The distributed environment is inherently capable of parallel processing and requires a proper data and work distribution. Our research is concentrated on three areas: unstructured text handling, data deduplication and on-line streaming data processing. We are also active in the area of Computer Science Education.

We focus on cryptography and computer security, discrete mathematics, coding theory and statistical design. We have extensive experience in applied cryptography, especially public key cryptosystems (elliptic curve cryptosystems), cryptographic protocols (AKC) and their implementations in restricted environments, such as smart cards (including HSM and FPGA). We also study algebraic combinatorics (distance-regular graphs, association schemes, finite geometries, codes, finite fields and the like), probability and statistics.

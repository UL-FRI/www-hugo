The laboratory is involved in basic and applied research of visually enabled intelligent systems. We have extensive experience with visual object tracking, object detection and categorization, incremental visual learning, as well as with systems for human-robot interactive learning and the development of computer vision solutions for smart mobile devices. Our experience has been accumulated in collaboration with a variety of research partners in a number of the EU, national and industry funded projects which address these research issues.

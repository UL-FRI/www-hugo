We conduct research in the areas of approximation and randomised algorithms, linear algebra (matrix multiplication), combinatorial optimisation (routing, problems on graphs, issues regarding the robustness of a facility location), parallel computation (algorithm mapping and scheduling, algorithms in parallel systems, hardware supported multithreading, dataflow computing), algorithm engineering and experimental algorithmics (boosting algorithm efficiency in practice), compiler design (parsing methods, attribute grammars), operating system design, grid computing (data replication on data grids), as well as computability and complexity theory.

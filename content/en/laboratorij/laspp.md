Our main research topics include development of adaptive algorithms in areas of artificial neural networks, data clustering, data mining, information-theoretic modelling and reinforcement learning, and design of computer systems, ranging from high performance computing to on-chip designs. We are mainly focused on problems where the lack of theoretical knowledge prevents exact solutions and where special software and hardware are demanded for efficient processing. We are also involved in digital logic design of arithmetic circuits, processing on GPUs, and smart wireless sensor networks. More recently, the laboratory is engaged also in experimental research in the field of wireless networks, radio-based localisation and software-defined radio.

I am a third year PhD student in Computer Science ant Faculty of Computer Science and member of the Bioinformatics Laboratory (Biolab). My research lies on the intersection of machine learning, bioinformatics and computational biology. Specifically, my work concerns learning from multiple data sources, kernel methods and low-rank matrix approximation, focusing on scability and computational complexity. These considerations are essential when dealing with large datasets, such as protein-RNA interactions or modeling gene regulatory networks.
 
The teaching duties include courses Introduction to Bioinformatics, Algorithms and Data Structures, Data Mining and Programming. In every course, I try to project the contents based on solid mathematical principles from logic, probability and linear algebra.
Activities and Events
I am a part of the Orange Data Mining development team.

Since 2009, she is a member of research program Pervasive computing which covers new computing paradigms and strongly linked networks with diverse computing devices.
By discovering the possibilities and emerge importance of radiofrequency identification in computer science applications, she started to encourage students with mentoring their bachelor thesis by using the technology in smart home applications and other fields. In 2008 she started the collaboration with a group at the University of Wolverhampton, UK and became a partner in an European project F2F – RFID from Farm to Fork which started in 2010.

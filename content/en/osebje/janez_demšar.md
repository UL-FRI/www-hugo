I research machine learning, data mining, with emphasis on data visualization, and I know some statistics. I spend most of my time programming an open-source component-based system for machine learning and data mining Orange. I was also involved in development of an inteligent assistant for discovery of genetic networks from mutant data GenePath.
I also teach courses in programming and in didactics of computer science. My wife and I translated the material from CS Unplugged to Slovenian, I teach Scratch in primary schools, I'm guilty that summer schools at the faculty have been extended to primary school children, I am a member of program committee of the Bebras competition, I am quite involved in the organization of Code Week and give professional development courses to teachers.
Education
I studied computer science at the Faculty of  Computer and Information Science in Ljubljana, where I received BSc degree in 1996, MSc in 1999 and PhD in 2002, all under mentorship of prof. Dr. Bratko and co-mentorship of prof. Dr. Blaz Zupan. The area of the dissertation was artificial inteligence, in particular function decomposition, a method for data-based constructive induction without a predefined set of operators.

My research and professional work is in the field of probability, statistics, machine learning, and applications of these methods to interesting practical problems that require such data analysis and modelling. I'm especially interested in Markov and other stochastic processes, Monte Carlo methods, Bayesian statistics, and the use of quantitative methods in sports (player evaluation, simulation, statistical analysis, forecasting).

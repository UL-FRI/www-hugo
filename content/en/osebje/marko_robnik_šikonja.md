My research interests include machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analysis, cognitive modeling, artificial intelligence, and their applications. In machine learning and data mining I am interested in ensemble learning, feature evaluation, probability prediction, cost-sensitive learning, feature subset selection, regression, natural language processing, and constructive induction (recent papers, free software). I am (co)author of approximately 50 publications. My papers have more than 2000 citations according to Scholar.
More about me is on my personal web site. I tweet as @MarkoRobnikS.
Education
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Informatics from University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences in 2001 (I graduated in 1993 and finished my M.Sc. in 1997 at the same institution).

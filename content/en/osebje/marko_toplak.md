I perform research in machine learning, focusing on the use of background knowledge for building prediction models. In collaboration with partners, such as a group at Baylor College of Medicine that studies a social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, we analyse gene expression data. I help develop Orange, a data mining toolkit, and its Bioinformatics add-on. I like Python, nature and to move.
I am a teaching assistant for Programming 1, Bussiness inteligence and Introduction to bioinformatics in academic year 2012/13.
My desk is in R3.22.

I am a member of the Laboratory for algorithms and data structures and mostly interested in algorithms, discrete problems, combinatorial optimization, computational complexity as well as operating systems, virtual machines and system software. At first my focus was more theoretical but now I am quite excited on bridging the gap between theory and practice and hence the specific areas such as algorithm engineering, experimental algorithmics, beyond worst-case analysis and also development of system software.
